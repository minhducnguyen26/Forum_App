# Forum_App

This was my first Vue CLI project that really got me into using Vue.js and understanding more about it. The app itself was very basic: everybody can create a thread or create a post for a specific thread in the forum. Working with components, Vue router, managing the directories, and the use of Vue animation were the things that I picked up while building this web app. At this moment, the app is available for desktop and big screen size.

This is the link to the web app. Please feel free to check it out and give me feedbacks, thank you!
